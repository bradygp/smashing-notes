# Selling Design Systems

Book: Font-end Style Guides

Thought building a design library would be similar to building with legos, but it didn't work out that way.

## Why design systems are awesome
1. They keep your website consistent. 
2. Team has a shared vocabulary - one of the biggest road blocks when working together is lack of a shared vocabulary. This helps people to take ownership of style guides.
3. They educate people about the world (speakers favorite) 
4. You can develop new features faster
5. if your developing faster, your saving money
6. They help future-proof your website. By documenting everything, new people can use the design system as a learning tool to keep everything consistent.

'Lonley Planet' is the favorite design system of the speaker. 

## Whey design systems are not awesome
1. they're a lot of work
2. Maintenance is hard (hasn't found a way to maintain them yet)
3. They're all kinds of confusing, there is no right way to make one. 
4. You can't guarantee ROI

## Do you really need a design system (aka what kind of design system do you need?)
1 What is the size of your team? Smaller teams are less likely to need one, espically if they're co-located.
 * you may still need one, just more loosely documented
2. How mature is your brand?
3. Do you have the right mentality?
4. Do you have a problem that a design system can solve? this is the most important consideration

## Get buy-in from your team
1. find a common pain that a design system can help fix. The more pains you can solve, the more valuable this will be. The first thing to do is talk to people in orginazation and talk about what pains them, don't try and steer the conversation or mention a design system. 
2. set some goals and success metrics for design system. 
3. do a small test project
4. present your findings to people in your company. This isn't always necessary, espically in a company with fewer layers
