A web site should be loaded in less than a second; we should reduce the number of server requests; keep your javascript and CSS files merge and compressed under 50 kilobytes.” – these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle the performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests. Performance is not about Mathematics. 
Performance is about Perception. Thereby user’s perception of your website’s speed is the only true performance measure.
