## Schedule

### Tuesday 4/4/17
#### 0800 Doors Open
#### 0900 Welcome and Intro
#### 0920 Deconstructing Performance - [Denys Mishunov](https://smashingconf.com/speakers/denys-mishunov)
A web site should be loaded in less than a second; we should reduce the number of server requests; keep your javascript and CSS files merge and compressed under 50 kilobytes.” – these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle the performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests. Performance is not about Mathematics. 

Performance is about Perception. Thereby user’s perception of your website’s speed is the only true performance measure.

#### 1010 Selling Design Systems - [Laura Elizabeth](https://smashingconf.com/speakers/laura-elizabeth)
The battle between designer and developer has often been written about. An oversimplified conclusion to these posts would be to empathise and learn the basics of the other’s craft. This is great advice but not very practical.

Pattern Libraries (or style guides) not only help the developer implement the designer’s work more easily, they also force the designer to think about how their work is going to be used in the web.

Pattern Libraries could very well be the end of the war between the two disciplines. This talk will outline not only the why of the Pattern Library but also (and crucially) the how.

#### 1100 Morning Break

#### 1130 CSS and Interactive Email - (Mark Robbins)[https://smashingconf.com/speakers/mark-robbins]
Email has often been overlooked as simplistic, outdated and limited but with modern webkit based email clients accounting for over 60% of opens the possibilities have really opened up. The new age of email is a fully interactive experience based in modern CSS (with a solid fallback for Outlook).
