# Preface
  - I'm a very "by-the-numbers" person, this talk is based on pyschology.

# Intro
 > Performance isn't really about milliseconds and kilobytes, it's about perception. If you are waiting for a bus for 15 minutes, but it feels like 30, does that make it better? People hate waiting.
  - Who uses Amazon? Load time?
  - 13s to fully load. But 1.7s to start rendering

# Activity
  - Pass out sticky notes & pens
  - People will wait, then write down how long they *think* they waited

# Stories
## Houston Airport
  - customers complained about wait-times for checked baggage
    - It took bags 8 minutes. 
    - Customers walked 1 minute, and waited 7
  - the solution was to park planes further away
    - bags still took 8 minutes
    - customers walked for 6 minutes, and waited for 2 minutes

## Disney
  - You have to wait at disney, no way around it (yet)
  - They are upfront with how long people will be waiting (they often overestimate)
  - Lines are filled with mini-games and things to look at (keep people busy)
  - Disney characters dispatched to overcrowded lines

# Active Phase & Passive Phase
  - Active Phase - Waiting with some kind of mental or physical activity
    - riding a bike
  - Passive Phase - Waiting with no sense of choice/control
    - waiting in a line
# Just Noticable Difference (20% Rule)
  - performance increases need to be %20+ to be noticable
  - the reverse is true
  - noticable != meaningful

# Examples
## Cross Walks
  - Most city cross walk buttons don't function
  - They are there to give the pedestrian a sense of control
    - passive phase -> active phase

## Houston Airport
  - Passengers: 1m active & 7m passive --> 6m active & 2m passive
