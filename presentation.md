# IMPROVING PERFORMANCE BY HACKING THE USER
 - perface
## Monolouge
Performance isn't really about milliseconds and kilobytes, it's about perception. If you are waiting for a bus for 15 minutes, but it feels like 30, does that make it better? People hate waiting.

## LET'S DO AN ACTIVITY
Give everyone a post-it note and pen, tell them we will all be waiting and the writing down how long they think they waited for. Participants shouldn't mentally keep track of the time, or watch a clock (that's cheating). At the end of some time between 30s - 2min have the participants write down how long they waited and compute the average. 

- distribute post-it notes & pens
- we will be waiting a period of time, then recording how long we *think* we waited
    - no cheating (counting, clock-watching, etc.)
- after 30s - 2min stop the activity, collect the papers and calculate the average.

## STORY TIME
### THE AIRPORT & THE BAGGAGE
In [2009 the Houston Airport](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html) regularly recieved a large number of complaints about the time it took for checked bags to reach the luggage carousel. On average, it would take bags 8 minutes to make their way to the carousel. Passengers would spend 1 minute walking to the baggage claim, and 7 minutes waiting for their luggage to arrive. The executives at the Houston Airport were able to basically stop these complaints by parking planes further away from the baggage claim area, and by sending passenger's luggage to the furtherest carousel. This caused passengers to spend 6 minutes walking and 2 minutes waiting.

## Reflecting
### THE AIRPORT & THE BAGGAGE - REVISITED
This story highlights that waiting is what users had a problem with, not the total amount of time it took their luggage to reach the carousel. By having users spending more time in the active phase (walking) and less time in the passive phase (waiting) they were able to reduce the number of complaints they recieved to nearly 0.
