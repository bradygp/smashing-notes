# IMPROVING PERFORMANCE BY HACKING THE USER
 - perface
## Monolouge
Performance isn't really about milliseconds and kilobytes, it's about perception. If you are waiting for a bus for 15 minutes, but it feels like 30, does that make it better? People hate waiting.

## LET'S DO AN ACTIVITY
Give everyone a post-it note and pen, tell them we will all be waiting and the writing down how long they think they waited for. Participants shouldn't mentally keep track of the time, or watch a clock (that's cheating). At the end of some time between 30s - 2min have the participants write down how long they waited and compute the average. 

- distribute post-it notes & pens
- we will be waiting a period of time, then recording how long we *think* we waited
    - no cheating (counting, clock-watching, etc.)
- after 30s - 2min stop the activity, collect the papers and calculate the average.

## STORY TIME
### THE AIRPORT & THE BAGGAGE
In [2009 the Houston Airport](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html) regularly recieved a large number of complaints about the time it took for checked bags to reach the luggage carousel. On average, it would take bags 8 minutes to make their way to the carousel. Passengers would spend 1 minute walking to the baggage claim, and 7 minutes waiting for their luggage to arrive. The executives at the Houston Airport were able to basically stop these complaints by parking planes further away from the baggage claim area, and by sending passenger's luggage to the furtherest carousel. This caused passengers to spend 6 minutes walking and 2 minutes waiting. 
### WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS
Disney is a master of having people wait in lines, and have been working on this issue for decades. There are several tricks they have in their toolbelt for waiting customers. At the entrances to every ride is an estimated time of how long it will take to go through the line (often overexaggrated). Every line is filled with things to look at, mini-games, and visits from disney characters when a line becomes exceptionally busy. Each line is long and wound up, there is a steady stream of forward motion with only short stops every so often. 

## ACTIVE PHASE VS. PASSIVE PHASE
Waiting can be divided into 2 phases, the active phase and the passive phase. The active phase is is characterized by the user's mental activity, usually some sort of mental or physical activity like riding a bike or solving a puzzle. The passive phase is the period of time in which the user has no choice or control over the waiting time, such as waiting in line. Research has shown that, on average, people in the passive phase overestimate their waiting time by about 36%.

## REFLECTING
### THE AIRPORT & THE BAGGAGE - REVISITED
This story highlights that waiting is what users had a problem with, not the total amount of time it took their luggage to reach the carousel. By having users spending more time in the active phase (walking) and less time in the passive phase (waiting) they were able to reduce the number of complaints they recieved to nearly 0.

### WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS - REVISITED
Disney attacks waiting on multiple fronts. By providing an overexaggrated wait-time estimate, they are setting user expectations, and then surpassing them. By providing distractions during the time patrons are in a queue, -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

## WHAT ARE OTHER TECH COMPANIES DOING?
Youtube makes an effort to get users into the active phase as quickly as possible. They could spend 30 seconds downloading the full video to your browser before playing, thus putting the user in the passive phase for that length of time. They instead only download the first few seconds before playing the video (switching the user to the active phase) and continue downloading the rest of the video in the background.

The Safari browswer for iOS provides a "Top Hit" selection whenever a user is inputting a new url into the search bar. The top hit is the website safari thinks is the most likely one you are trying to type in. As soon as any website appears as an option for the Top Hit, Safari will begin downloading the website in the background. If the user does chose that site, their website will already be loaded on the phone.
